Aight, so I realized something when I was taking a walk this evening. On why I just couldn't read something. For starters, I am a very expressive person, I cannot live without creating something when I consume a lot. The last book I 'read' was 'Everything has a story' by Savi Sharma. And I totally "consumed it". By that I mean, I didn't indulge in pausing and taking in what I was reading at any point of the read; I was just feeling it without any phase difference. Now, I have something to say about that; it will be clear soon. So, I was able to finish it pretty soon. And then of course I was brim with emotions, that lead to probably a revolutionary change in me, I started writing about something very deep that I have felt. [It was not necessarily a good writing, but I mean art need not be good first, it needs to be expressive]

Whenever I read a book; let's take example here; I was reading 'The Wild Himalaya' the other summer, and I just couldn't move ahead. For, for every little instance I read, I had to imagine and feel the stuff that was actually going on. It was too much for me to; let's put it - "watch a WHOLE MOVIE at very point" - "construct a whole fking TANGENT SPACE at every freaking point". That's too much :kramer:. You see what's film now. It's an expression so profound that one indulges in months of focus to create something so enticing and profound!! For, it's what they are like, they make films, they tell stories otherwise couldn't. Bbbut that's an extreme level of expressive needs that directors have. Let us back off and talk about myself. So turns out I am a kind of guy who is expressive; (now you see where I'm going :D), expressive so much that it take a lot of time for me to move ahead in reading, it takes time to really figure out the expressions there and create or feel something out of that heavily consumed frame of mind. And by the time I am assimilating these tendencies of expressive needs, it beats my mind that reading can be done this way. I was in a notion that reading is something that happens faster than whatever I was doing. But I do know it's very common to do longer reads, but I didn't know how long. All I kinda felt is that it would take me an un-ordinarily gynormous amount of time. I mean the expressive needs are subjective but they lie in somewhere between a fast read and a Christopher Nolan direction or Hans Zimmer composition for a usual guy like us. I mean we are not full time artist heh; so we do have bounds on expressions. Unless of course if one wants to delve into the other paths and intertwine the operations, and it is very cool to do so.(imagine me being:_quiet excited about it :D_) So probably I am that kind of person, where it could take an enormous amount of time which would be considered rather stupendous by the reading community. Or at least that's what I have subconciously opined and just didn't bother to read. It's more like, I couldn't grasp all of these expressive things so clearly like this that I could appreciate the process of reading or respect my thoughts on reading. So now coming to the fact: the only book that I read is that one by Savi Sharma, makes me think; (_in a very calm, keen and curative way_) was that book a book that was written like a fcking movie?

Now, things have already rasied to the power of nerd here, I mean at this point it's also unclear of what a common movie is, I mean imagine the different expressive needs and the works of expression. That's a whole fking new way to see things; one's movie is(not) one's writing and one's reading is(not) one's movie. Just think about it, I say this book is a movie and it makes sense in the expressive notion.

Okay this makes more sense when I just already clarify that movie is something that is an in-phase expressive experience (although it need not, and that's only another cycle of things fuck). Now, it's very thin, the thoughts are already on the verge of blowing up, everything is subjective at this point purely depending on one's expressive needs. So let's just pause here and talk about the book and myself.

So, yeah given my artistic level of disposition I did feel the book in phase. I don't imagine every book to be the same though. And one would probably say that a book must give some time to the reader to assimilate and create something. But the book by Savi Sharma is still a book. And it's interesting that the experience was as if I was watching the movie. The experience obvously should differ from person to person. I have abstractified so much here that people might bluntly put the book as straightforward, or no creative ingenuity (that it's not so much different from a movie) and yada yada. But I hope that's a bull shit talk, because I know that it did sell well. But I will leave it to literary critics to talk about these aspects. I would love to hear from someone though, it clarifies many things, and lets me live outside my head too xd.

Alright now that things are clear, let me think about Prayag's instance. He told me how, movies don't offer that freedom to be more imaginative or smtng like that (I don't say I got the right word or anything just put a placeholder for now). But it could be again the same thing to you. You are watching the movie, and kind of into another expressive disposition where one wants to write the story in a very imaginative, elaborate or abstract or whatever way. That's where a writer falls.

So is it fair enough to say that expressive individuals lie somewhere from writers to directors? But then this is too one dimensional. And I don't want to restrict myself in this lowly dimension. There are artists into very wide range of forms of expression that a dimensional analysis like this just doesn't cut the complexity of humanity. So, all I would say is come on; let's admit that our expressions are unique and it's worth embracing them and live accordingly. I mean just look at how I use scientific terminology from mathematics or physics to express something. It's just mind blowing.

That was the dimensional analysis of Expressions, and this is Shubhang signing off.
