          On how Equivalence principle, a local theory of gravity, viz. a mere pseudoforce, can be extended to the whole
          of space where fields could be non-uniform. I am tending to think that, the space-time dependence of metric
          rightly captures the non-uniform nature of gravity, i.e a space-time dependent coordinate transformation (that
          takes us out of flat metric) that
          gives out the right gravitational/pseudo force. Recall that gravitational\pseduo force vanishes when the
          metric is flat, so the transformation to a non-inertial frame necessarily involves leaving the flat metric
          behind. But there also exist coordinate transformations that <i>preserve</i> the flatness of the metric and
          also give a space-time dependence to the metric, (like Cartesian to Spherical coordinates). But to rightly
          make use of the equivalence principle, one must sperate those <i>flatness preserving</i> transformations from
          the more general transformations (to non-inertial frames)... so that all we need to now do is to find the
          terms that are needed to
          be added to a flat metric to give out the right gravitational/pseudo field. How does one find such terms? We
          feed in the <i>source terms.</i>

          Before dealing with the source, we must begin the mathematical study of curvature... And then when we are equipped with enough metric dependent
          tools, we can
          feed in the physical information to solve for the metric to compute the acceleration of a particle in any non-inertial
          frame, thus the gravitational field.

      Now, I finally feel the infamous statement!

      <blockquote><i><b>Matter tells space-time how to bend/curve, and curvature tells matter how to move!</b></i></blockquote>

        <div class="pad"> (VIII | 04-02-2024| <b>Relativistic Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory</b>) This is about the
          general(with regards to massive or massless particle)
          relativistic action of a free particle. This action gives out a Hamiltonian which is simply 0!. What's the
          physics behind this? Connection to Klein
          Gordon Equation and the Quantization... Perhaps we should also talk about second Quantization right here,
          because Dr. X used the term in a kinda convincing way, but was it all just a sham?

            Will try to $\LaTeX$ the calculations here soon.
