        <h1 class="center">Celebrating Quantum Field Theory!</h1>
        <p class="center">(April 2024)</p>

        <p>Back when I was in second and third years here at NISER, I found the idea of Quantum Field Theory quite
            exciting
            and was looking forward to get to know how all the fundamental stuff is calculated. I think much of the
            longing
            came from the book <i>Surely you are joking Mr. Feynman</i>. I wished for someone to just talk about it
            and pass the feels. Of course David Tong did, and I was waiting to see the calculations myself. Of course, I
            was
            no way ready until this semester to understand such calculations, but
            you get it. I was excited, and also patient.
            And today we finished calculating the anomalous magnetic moment!
            Yes, for which Schwinger was awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize, and is one of the most accurate theoretical and
            experimental agreement in the history of phyiscs. I am elated and I am going to celebrate this
            with a series of articles on some fundamental QFT results, that could probably keep the excitement high for
            the studfents in their junior years. I'm writing this atleast for my third year self, and out of as I said
            celebration of QFT education.</p>


        Here's something that I sent in our QFT-II Google Classroom:

        <blockquote>
            ðŸŽ‰A milestone in our QFT education! Here is a lecture straight from one of the creators. A video recording
            of
            Feynman talking about the calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment :). If I am not wrong, he is
            referring to
            the value of g/2.
