                        In a very interesting situation of reading depths of stuff to understand the basic of them.
                        Because, how can one just understand something from up above? One has to dive in and assume some
                        stuff, put some stuff to later studies maybe but one has to dive in and play around...This time
                        its related to lasers and their time-dependent behaviour, more specifically relaxation
                        oscillations and Q-switching. Also, I don't agree with people who say understand something
                        without going to deep or complicating it ... for some complexity becomes natural and go deep in
                        some level to udnerstand the actual picture... But ofcourse, I don't expect everyone to feel that way. So let's just be accepting to all type of thinkers. Eg.
                        Sourav's question on spin interaction with Polarization, my first viva on lasers...

                    </li>
                    <li>Nope don't feel like studying anything honestly. I should probably take a nice break for myself,
                        have been working on QFT assignment for too long, even today!</li>

                        <p>Was planning to write expository(just a structured writing of course lectures) notes on Dirac
                            Equation. Although I love the idea, at present I don't think I am in a mood to carefully
                            write
                            the theory in a place. It's just like that sometimes. I am peacefully postponing the activity
                            to
                            some other time, may be while I prepare for mid-semester exams and for now let me just
                            continue
                            to just revise the class notes before working on the assignment.</p>
